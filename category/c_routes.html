intro: "
  <p>The routes below, all leaving from Lake Hiawatha Park, follow some popular
  and safe routes to different parks and activities. We'll use some of these
  for Kidical Mass rides. Others are just for fun and inspiration!</p>
  <p>My hope is that we can build a library of routes for a variety of locations
  and destinations across the city. If you have ideas or would like to
  contribute, please let me know!</p>
