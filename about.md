## About Us
Kidical Mass South Minneapolis organizes monthly family-oriented, kid-friendly group bike rides on second Saturdays at 10am, leaving from Lake Hiawatha Park.

Rides will be 1-4 miles in length along bike-friendly roads and bike paths. Routes will be announced in advance, and we'll do our best to visit places with restrooms and nearby food.

We ride as a group and no one will be left behind!

If you have any questions, please [get in touch](mailto:hooker001@gmail.com).

## About Kidical Mass
Kidical Mass is a legal, safe and FUN bike ride for kids, kids at heart, and their families. The first ride was held in April 2008 in Eugene, Oregon and has now spread to over a dozen communities throughout North America and beyond. We celebrate the fact that Kids are Traffic Too and aim for family fun.
