Every June, there is a day called [National Get Outdoors Day](http://www.nationalgetoutdoorsday.org/). In 2017, Powderhorn Park brought all kinds of outdoor activities to the park to celebrate. There was free fishing, craft making, outdoor demos from REI and some live music, too. We're hoping for a repeat in 2018!

This ride takes quiet neighborhood streets through Standish and Corcoran.
