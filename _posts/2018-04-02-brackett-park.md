[Brackett Park](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/brackett_field_park/) is a classic Minneapolis park in the Seward neighborhood. It's right on the greenway, super close to the river, and it is literally right smack in between [Birchwood Cafe](https://www.birchwoodcafe.com/) and [Hi-Lo Diner](http://www.hi-lo-diner.com/). Just sayin'.

Don't miss the famous rocket! Once a radical climbing structure to the stars, it's now a sculpture due to age (and probably "liability").

## Summary
Take 42nd St. across Hiawatha to all the way to West River Road. Hang a left and follow the river north to 29th St., just past the Lake Street bridge.

At 29th, hop off onto Dorman Ave, which is like a frontage road to the river, and go left on 28th St. Couple more blocks and you're there.

Bike racks by the playground.

## Turn-by-Turn
* Leave Lake Hiawatha Park on 27th Ave. heading **north**.
* Go **right** on 42nd St. and follow this across Hiawatha Ave. all the way to West River Pkwy (where it will dead-end).
* Go **left** onto the West River Pkwy bike trail (heading **north**). Follow the trail until you get past Lake Street. *If you're unfamiliar, Lake Street is technically 30th St. There's a big bridge, which you will pass under.*
* Go **left** at the first curb cut past Lake Street. This is 29th St.
* Quickly go **right** onto Dorman Ave (basically a frontage road).
* Go **left** on 28th St. Brackett Park will be on your right as you reach 38th Ave.
* **if you missed Dorman** that's OK! Just take 29th St. and go **right** at 38th Ave. -- you'll hit the park in a block!
