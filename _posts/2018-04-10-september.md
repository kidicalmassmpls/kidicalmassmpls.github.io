The too-quickly-approaching fall reminds us to take advantage of hopefully-still-warm weather, and to celebrate the Monarch migration at the 10th annual Minneapolis Monarch Festival at Lake Nokomis Community Center.

We will ride a loop around the lake before stopping at the Nokomis Community Center for the event.
