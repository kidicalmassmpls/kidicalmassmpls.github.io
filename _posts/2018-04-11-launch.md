It's finally here! Time to start thinking about warmer weather (if it will ever come), getting outside and Kidical Mass family bike rides! We're going to do things pretty similar to last year, with a couple key logistical changes that I will highlight in this post.

First of all, you might have noticed the website! This is brand new for this year, and is an effort on our part to branch out and allow people to get connected to Kidical Mass without needing to use Facebook. Please [sign up for the mailing list](http://eepurl.com/do4hJX) to stay informed on ride reminders and other fun stuff. The [Kidical Mass South Minneapolis Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/kidicalmassmpls/) will continue to operate as normal, so if you are already there, or would like to join, please do so!

The other goal of this website is to start to create a library of safe and fun [family biking routes](/routes/) across the Twin Cities. I am starting in South Minneapolis with the routes we have used in Kidical Mass, but my goal would be to expand this library to any fun family-friendly bike routes that others can use for inspiration and ride planning with the families. If you have ideas or would like to contribute a route, please let us know.

That all said, we're here to ride! Check out the [2018 Ride Calendar]({% post_url 2018-04-11-calendar %}) for all the details.
