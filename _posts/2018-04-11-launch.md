Kidical Mass South Minneapolis organizes monthly family-oriented, kid-friendly group bike rides on second Saturdays at 10am, leaving from Lake Hiawatha Park.

## Logistics
* We host regular monthly rides May - October.
* Regular monthly rides take place on the second Saturday of the month.
* We meet at 10am, and roll at 10:15.
* Rides always leave from [Lake Hiawatha Park](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/lake_hiawatha_park/). We meet by the bike racks next to the playground.
* Rides end at a different park each month. We make our own way home, but often there's a few folks to ride with back toward Lake Hiawatha.
* We ride rain or shine. Dress for the weather!

## Family Bike Routes
The other goal of this website is to create a library of safe and fun [family bike routes](/family-bike-routes/) in South Minneapolis.

Initially this will be the routes we have used on Kidical Mass rides, but my goal would be to expand this library to any routes that others can use for inspiration and for family biking. If you have ideas or would like to contribute a route, please get in touch.

## Stay In Touch
