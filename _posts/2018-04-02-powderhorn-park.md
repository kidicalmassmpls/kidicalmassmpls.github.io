[Powderhorn Park](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/powderhorn_park/)! An institution known for its annual May Day festival, Powderhorn has a little bit of everything. A splashpad, a small lake, fishing dock, rolling hills and a playground.

We've done Powderhorn in June with Kidical Mass before when our dates have coincided with National Get Outdoors Day, as the park has played host to a wide variety of outdoor activities for kids. But I bet you can go any day of the year and find something to do!

## Summary
This one takes neighborhood streets the whole way. I've got my own take on the Standish streets, which I will share here, but do what works for you. There are a number of bike routes and quiet streets that can get you across the neighborhood.

The goal is to make it to the 17th Ave. bike boulevard. To get there, I like to take 41st St. to Longfellow Ave., crossing Cedar at 40th St. I don't take 40th St. the whole way. While it is technically a bike boulevard, it goes down/up a massive hill next to Sibley Park, which I try and avoid with the kids.

Crossing Cedar at 40th St., you arrive at 17th Ave. and take that to 34th St., where you will go left and drop into the park.

## Turn-by-Turn
* Leave Lake Hiawatha Park on 27th Ave. heading **north**.
* Straight across 42nd St. and head one block to 41st St.
* Go **left** onto 41st St. and go **west** several blocks to Longfellow Ave. (Don't cross Cedar Ave. on 41st!)
* Go **right** onto Longfellow Ave. for one block.
* Go **left** on 40th St. and cross Cedar Ave. at the stoplight.
* Go **right** onto 17th Ave. Don't let your momentum take you too far down the hill! I've missed this turn before... more than once.
* Follow 17th Ave. **north** across 35th St.
* Go **left** on 34th St. and poke your way carefully across Bloomington Ave. to the park.
