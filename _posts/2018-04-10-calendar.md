Let's get to the good stuff!

## 2018 details
* We host regular rides May - October
* Regular rides take place on the second saturday of the month. We meet at 10am, and roll at 10:15.
* Rides always leave from [Lake Hiawatha Park](https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/lake_hiawatha_park/). We meet by the bike racks next to the playground.
* Rides end at a different park each month. We try to go to places that are seasonally appropriate. By that I mean in July and August, we're definitely going somwehere with a pool :)
