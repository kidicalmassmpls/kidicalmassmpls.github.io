Finally. Some warmer weather. We'll take an amble along West River Parkway to Brackett Park, a veritable institution of a park in Seward. There's a fun zero-entry pool and a great playground.

Getting to the river trail involves a stretch down 42nd St. which has a bike lane. There are a couple tight spots, especially at Hiawatha and Minnehaha Aves. We always stick together as a group at any large intersection for maximum safety.
